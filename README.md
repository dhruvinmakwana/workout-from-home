# ActiveAR

In the modern era, where people have a hectic lifestyle, spending time and money going to the gym is getting tough. In addition, since the covid started, it became even harder to go to the gym in order to be fit. So, most people started working out at home, but with the wrong posture. So, to solve the issue, we hereby created an app called ActiveAR which helps in correcting the bad posture of the person and helps them achieve their fitness goals safely and effectively with the help of Augmented Reality. In this project, we have created a Web-based app along with its wrapper for Mobile devices which runs on JavaScript and our own AR engine. Augmented reality is a combination of the real and virtual world which allows real-time interaction with the user and the AR engine. We have used various AR functionalities in our application in order to give proper posture suggestions. It calculates the repetitions and sets performed by the user. It also calculates the accuracy at the end of a workout session. This will enable users to effectively perform workouts at the ease of being at home.
